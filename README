Improvement analysis of improved mluscheme evaluater:
When running the old mlscheme interpreter, it took 5.03 seconds;
after implementing adjusted rho environment that contains only free variables,
now the improved version can run in 1.4 seconds, this is about 3.5 seconds
of improvement. In addition, the runtime of unoptimized C interpreter code is
24.9 seconds.

Any comments or feedback for course staff: nope, all goodie~
